        "description": "AI Fund is a venture studio that partners with entrepreneurs to build AI companies that move humanity forward. We don't just provide capital, we actively help build the company: we seek to play at least a minor co-founder role in the companies we engage in. \n\nAfter identifying a concrete startup idea, we actively help the founder validate both customer need and technical feasibility (often collaborating to build a technical prototype), help shape the AI technology roadmap, the go-to-market, and help recruit the key leaders, including the AI engineering team. \n\nBecause AI is a general purpose technology that can be applied to numerous sectors -- including ones that we at AI Fund don't have expertise in -- we partner with subject matter experts (SMEs) in logistics, healthcare, education, relationships, finance, and other sectors. By leveraging our AI expertise and the SME's expertise in an important application sector, we can build a promising AI business in that sector. \n\nWe take responsible AI seriously and will, on ethical grounds, choose not to pursue projects that we otherwise assess to be financially sound.",

Using Landing AI's tools, many vision projects that used to take 6-12 months can now be built in days, and deployed at either cloud or edge. \n\nEnabled by the Transformer neural network (created by the Google Brain team), the Generative AI revolution has arrived in text processing. By scaling up the more recent Vision Transformer neural network, we believe a revolution is also coming in image processing. Landing AI is developing these technologies to offer an easy, low code platform for computer vision, which users are applying in manufacturing inspection, industrial automation, life sciences, agriculture, geo-spatial imagery, and other sectors. \n\nKey technical innovations include Data-centric AI, the discipline of systematically engineering data to build an AI system, and Visual Prompting, which allows you to build a computer vision system in seconds, via specifying a \"visual prompt\" by swiping a handful of pixels.",
